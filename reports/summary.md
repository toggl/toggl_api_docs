# Summary report

Summary report returns the aggregated time entries data.

## Request

In addition to the [standard request parameters](../reports.md#request-parameters), summaries accept the following additional parameters:
* `grouping`
* `subgrouping`
* `subgrouping_ids` (boolean) - whether returned items will contain 'ids' key containing comma separated group item ID values
* `grouped_time_entry_ids` (boolean) - whether returned items will contain 'time_entry_ids' key containing comma separated time entries ID values for given item

Use the grouping and subgrouping params to organize the data as needed. By default `grouping:projects` and `subgrouping:time_entries`

Following groupings with subgroupings are available in the summary report
* projects
  * time_entries
  * tasks
  * users
* clients
  * time_entries
  * tasks
  * projects
  * users
* users
  * time_entries
  * tasks
  * projects
  * clients

## Response

The response will include the [standard response parameters](../reports.md#successful-response).

### Data array

General structure of the item in the data array
* id: the id of the grouping object
* title: description of the item, this is an object depending of the grouping as follows:
  * `{project: "Project name", client: "Client name"}` if the grouping is projects
  * `{client: "Client name"}` if the grouping is clients
  * `{user: "User's name"}` if the grouping is users
* items: array of subgrouping items
  * title: title of the subgrouping item, an object depending of the grouping as follows
    * `{project: "Project name", client: "Client name"}` if the grouping is projects
    * `{client: "Client name"}` if the subgrouping is clients
    * `{user: "User's name"}` if the subgrouping is users
    * `{task: "Task name"}` if the subgrouping is tasks
    * `{time_entry: "Time entry description"}` if the subgrouping is time_entries
  * time: time in milliseconds spent on the subgrouping object
  * cur: currency of the subgrouping
  * sum: total amount of the subgrouping
  * rate: hourly rate that is used for calculating the subgrouping amount

```json
  {
    "id":1,
    "title":{},
    "time":14400000,
    "total_currencies":[{"currency":"","amount":null}],
    "items":[
      {
        "title":{},
        "time":14400000,
        "cur":"",
        "sum":null,
        "rate":null
      }
    ]
  }
```

## Project colors
When grouped by project the title part of the return will contain color and color_hex fields. First one contains the color id (returned also by APIv8), second one will return the corresponding HEX value. (Please note: color return is a subject of change).
