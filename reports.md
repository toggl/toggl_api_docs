##Authentication##

You can authenticate in the reports API **only** with your API token. 

For HTTP Basic Auth you have to add the Authorization header with the request. The token is sent as `user name` and the string `api_token` as the password. Whenever possible please use the tools and interfaces provided by your http library to do Basic Auth (for example, curl uses the -u switch for that).

The API expects the request parameters as the query string of the URL.

##Successful response##

The general structure of the successful response

```json
  {
    "total_grand":null,
    "total_billable":null,
    "total_currencies":[{"currency":null,"amount":null}],
    "data":[]
  }
```
The response may include some additional attributes depending on the report type, but the following are present in all of them. The main report data is inside the `data` array.

* **`total_grand`**: total time in milliseconds for the selected report
* **`total_billable`**: total billable time in milliseconds for the selected report
* **`total_currencies`**: an array with amounts and currencies for the selected report
* **`data`**: an array with detailed information of the requested report. The structure of the data in the array depends on the report.

##Failed requests##

In case of unsuccessful request the API returns the error in JSON and corresponding HTTP status code :

* **`message`**: the general message of the occurred error
* **`tip`**: what to do in case of this error
* **`code`**: status code of the response

An example error :

```json

    "error": {
      "message":"We are sorry, this Error should never happen to you",
      "tip":"Please contact support@toggl.com with information on your request",
      "code":500
    }
  }
