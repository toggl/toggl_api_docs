## Rate limiting ##

There is rate limiting of 1 request per second (per IP per API token), this
limit may change in future. In case client application exceeds rate limit
HTTP status 429 will be returned. Excessive requests may yield in stricter 
limits set upon token/IP combination.


## Authentication ##

You can authenticate in the reports API **only** with your API token. For HTTP Basic Auth you have to add the Authorization header with the request.
The API token is the user name and the string 'api_token' is the password.
Whenever possible please use the tools and interfaces provided by your http library to do Basic Auth (for example, curl uses the -u switch for that).


## Request Parameters ##

The API expects the request parameters as the query string of the URL.

The following parameters and filters can be used in all of the reports
* `user_agent`: **Required**. The name of your application or your email address so we can get in touch in case you're doing something wrong.
* `workspace_id`: **Required**. The workspace whose data you want to access.
* `since`: ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD) format. Defaults to 6 days before `until`.
* `until`: ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD) format. Defaults to today's date. (Note: Maximum date span (`until - since`) is one year.)
* `billable`: "yes", "no", or "both". Defaults to "both".
* `client_ids`: A list of client IDs separated by a comma. Use "0" if you want to filter out time entries without a client.
* `project_ids`: A list of project IDs separated by a comma. Use "0" if you want to filter out time entries without a project.
* `user_ids`: A list of user IDs separated by a comma.
* `members_of_group_ids`: A list of group IDs separated by a comma. This limits provided `user_ids` to the members of the given groups.
* `or_members_of_group_ids`: A list of group IDs separated by a comma. This extends provided `user_ids` with the members of the given groups.
* `tag_ids`: A list of tag IDs separated by a comma. Use "0" if you want to filter out time entries without a tag.
* `task_ids`: A list of task IDs separated by a comma. Use "0" if you want to filter out time entries without a task.
* `time_entry_ids`: A list of time entry IDs separated by a comma.
* `description`: Matches against time entry descriptions.
* `without_description`: "true" or "false". Filters out the time entries which do not have a description (literally "(no description)").
* `order_field`:
  * For detailed reports: "date", "description", "duration", or "user"
  * For summary reports: "title", "duration", or "amount"
  * For weekly reports: "title", "day1", "day2", "day3", "day4", "day5", "day6", "day7", or "week_total"
* `order_desc`: "on" for descending, or "off" for ascending order.
* `distinct_rates`: "on" or "off". Defaults to "off".
* `rounding`: "on" or "off". Defaults to "off". Rounds time according to workspace settings.
* `display_hours`: "decimal" or "minutes". Defaults to "minutes". Determines whether to display hours as a decimal number or with minutes.


## Successful response ##

The general structure of the successful response
```json
  {
    "total_grand":null,
    "total_billable":null,
    "total_currencies":[{"currency":null,"amount":null}],
    "data":[]
  }
```
The response may include some additional attributes depending on the report type, but the following are present in all of them. The main report data is inside the `data` array.

* total_grand: total time in milliseconds for the selected report
* total_billable: total billable time in milliseconds for the selected report
* total_currencies: an array with amounts and currencies for the selected report
* data: an array with detailed information of the requested report. The structure of the data in the array depends on the report.

## Failed requests ##

In case of unsuccessful request the API returns the error in JSON and corresponding HTTP status code
* message: the general message of the occurred error
* tip: what to do in case of this error
* code: status code of the response

Example error
```json
  {
    "error": {
      "message":"We are sorry, this Error should never happen to you",
      "tip":"Please contact support@toggl.com with information on your request",
      "code":500
    }
  }

```

Notable error codes: 

    402 Payment Required - feature is not included in current subscription level of
        workspace
    410 Gone -  this api version is deprecated. Update your client.
    429 Too Many Requests - add delay between requests.
  

To provide third-party developers with important information, we will use
[Warning](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.46) HTTP
header in api responses. We recommend to set up automated notifications for
Warning headers in all responses, in addition to notifying you about failed requests.

Example warning

    Warning:Human readable warning message

There are two test endpoints, that return error so you can test client side 
error handling: [Error 400](https://www.toggl.com/reports/api/v2/error400) and 
[Error 500](https://www.toggl.com/reports/api/v2/error500) both of them set 
Warning header to test value.
