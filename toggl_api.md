Toggl API v8
====================

The API accepts only JSON requests. Please make sure you're setting `Content-Type: application/json`in your request header. Each request returns a **JSON-encoded** body.
If the time entry is currently running, the *duration* attribute contains a negative value, denoting the start of the time entry in seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970). The correct duration can be calculated as current_time + duration, where current_time is the current time in seconds since epoch.

The result of each action is communicated via standard HTTP response codes.

### CORS ###

If you wish to use the API using CORS, we'll need to whitelist you first. Please refer to the [CORS documentation](https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs/blob/master/chapters/cors.md)

### Successful requests ###

When request is successful (2xx), a nested response object is returned. Fields which value is NULL are not in the response.

Example request

}
```

### Failed requests ###

If a create or update action failed, HTTP status code 404 and an array of localized error messages will be returned.

```

## Authentication ##

To use the API, you need to authenticate yourself. This can be done via HTTP POST or HTTP Basic Auth. After successful authentication a session is created using a cookie.

If authentication fails, HTTP status code 403 is returned. You can read more about authentication and see sample requests [here](chapters/authentication.md).
