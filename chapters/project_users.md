Project users
====================
Project user has the following properties

* **`pid`**: project ID (integer, required)
* **`uid`**: user ID, who is added to the project (integer, required)
* **`wid`**: workspace ID, where the project belongs to (integer, not-required, project's workspace id is used)
* **`manager`**: admin rights for this project (boolean, default false)
* **`rate`**: hourly rate for the project user (float, not-required, only for pro workspaces) in the currency of the project's client or in workspace default currency.
* **`at`**: timestamp that is sent in the response, indicates when the project user was last updated

*Workspace ID* `wid`, *project ID* `pid` and *user ID* `uid` properties can't be changed on update.


###Additional fields###
It's possible to get user's fullname. For that you have to send the `fields` parameter in request with desired property name.

* **`fullname`**: full name of the user, who is added to the project
