Dashboard
==========

Dashboard's main purpose is to give an overview of what users in the workspace are doing and have been doing.

Dashboard request returns two objects `activity` and `most active user`.

The `activity` object holds the data of 10 latest actions in the workspace. Activity object has the following properties :

* **`user_id`**: user ID
* **`project_id`**: project ID (ID is 0 if time entry doesn'y have project connected to it)
* **`duration`**: time entry duration in seconds. If the time entry is currently running, the duration attribute contains a negative value, denoting the start of the time entry in seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970). The correct duration can be calculated as current_time + duration, where current_time is the current time in seconds since epoch.
* **`description`**: (Description property is not present if time entry description is empty)
* **`stop`**: time entry stop time (ISO 8601 date and time. Stop property is not present when time entry is still running)
* **`tid`**: task id, if applicable

The `most active user` object holds the data of the top 5 users who have tracked the most time during last 7 days. The most active user object has the following properties :

* **`user_id`**: user ID
* **`duration`**: Sum of time entry durations that have been created during last 7 days
