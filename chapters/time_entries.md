Time Entries
====================

The requests are scoped with the user whose API token is used. Only his/her time entries are updated, retrieved and created.

Time entry has the following properties :

* **`description`**: (string, strongly suggested to be used)
* **`wid`**: workspace ID (integer, required if pid or tid not supplied)
* **`pid`**: project ID (integer, not required)
* **`tid`**: task ID (integer, not required)
* **`billable`**: (boolean, not required, default false, available for pro workspaces)
* **`start`**: time entry start time (string, required, ISO 8601 date and time)
* **`stop`**: time entry stop time (string, not required, ISO 8601 date and time)
* **`duration`**: time entry duration in seconds. If the time entry is currently running, the duration attribute contains a negative value, denoting the start of the time entry in seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970). The correct duration can be calculated as *current\_time* + *duration*, where *current\_time* is the current time in seconds since epoch. (integer, required)
* **`created_with`**: the name of your client app (string, required)
* **`tags`**: a list of tag names (array of strings, not required)
* **`duronly`**: should Toggl show the start and stop time of this time entry? (boolean, not required)
* **`at`**: timestamp that is sent in the response, indicates the time item was last updated

```

##Get time entries started in a specific time range##

`GET https://www.toggl.com/api/v8/time_entries`

With `start_date` and `end_date` parameters you can specify the date range of the time entries returned. If `start_date` and `end_date` are not specified, time entries started during the last 9 days are returned. 

**The limit of returned time entries is 1000,** so only the first 1000 found time entries are returned. To get all time entries for a specific time span, you should consider using the [detailed report](../reports/detailed.md) request, which returns paginated results, but enables you to get all the asked time entries with multiple requests.

`start_date` and `end_date` must be ISO 8601 date and time strings.

Example request with start date 2013-03-10T15:42:46+02:00 and end_date 2013-03-12T15:42:46+02:00

```shell
curl -v -u 1971800d4d82861d8f2c1651fea4d212:api_token \
	-X GET "https://www.toggl.com/api/v8/time_entries?start_date=2013-03-10T15%3A42%3A46%2B02%3A00&end_date=2013-03-12T15%3A42%3A46%2B02%3A00"

## Bulk update time entries tags ##

`PUT https://www.toggl.com/api/v8/time_entries/{time_entry_ids_separated_by_a_comma}`

You can mass assign and remove tags from time entries. Just instead of one `time_entry_id`, you need to send all the time entry ids, which you want to update, separated by a comma in the request url.
The request is similar to regular time entry update.

You can use the following properties:

* **`tags`**: a list of tag names (array of strings), providing only this atteribute overrides tags on the time entries.
* **`tag_action`**: (string, possible values: `add`, `remove`). Merges to or removes from the current time entry tags the values provided by the `tags` property.


Example request

```shell
curl -v -u 1971800d4d82861d8f2c1651fea4d212:api_token \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-d '{"time_entry":{"tags":["billed","productive"], "tag_action": "add"}}' \
	-X PUT https://www.toggl.com/api/v8/time_entries/436694100,436694101
```
