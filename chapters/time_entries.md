Time Entries
====================

The requests are scoped with the user whose API token is used. Only his/her time entries are updated, retrieved and created.

Time entry has the following properties
* description: (string, required)
* wid: workspace ID (integer, required if pid or tid not supplied)
* pid: project ID (integer, not required)
* tid: task ID (integer, not required)
* billable: (boolean, not required, default false, available for pro workspaces)
* start: time entry start time (string, required, ISO 8601 date and time)
* stop: time entry stop time (string, not required, ISO 8601 date and time)
* duration: time entry duration in seconds. If the time entry is currently running, the duration attribute contains a negative value, denoting the start of the time entry in seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970). The correct duration can be calculated as current_time + duration, where current_time is the current time in seconds since epoch. (integer, required)
* created_with: the name of your client app (string, required)
* tags: a list of tag names (array of strings, not required)
* duronly: should Toggl show the start and stop time of this time entry? (boolean, not required)
* at: timestamp that is sent in the response, indicates the time item was last updated
